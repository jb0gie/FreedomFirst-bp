a full eosio network for the freedom-first comminuty
before using the launch scripts, you need to set up a keys.conf file, make it executable, and fill it with the following

NAME=blockproducername

PRIVKEY=5XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX #your privkey here
PUBKEY=EOS8XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX #your pubkey here

we're starting an eos side-net (or full-network)
think about it this way: every app needs storage, you can store things on eos, and load them in websites, taking away the need to make products that manage user security and instead relying on eos for distribution, scalability and security
in other words: if you rely on eos for storage your app is twitch-grade or facebook-grade from the start
the other hugely cool thing about eos is it allows people to set up that storage and delivery network themselves, that's what we're doing, we're gonna eos
so, you can make tools that load and save things from it, that is the big purpose of eos, but that is just scratching the surface of what its capable of,, which is probably outside the scope of this conversation, the big point is it allows us all to have  a network that can relay information and store it, there is a lot of our lives that still rely on centralized things like discord, google, etc
we need to start making the tools that we can use to bypass those agencies that we should be avoiding at this day and age.

eos is the be-all-and-end-all back end solution for huge scalable web projects that milions of people use.

we're making an app-store like product called dconnect that will use this eos back end to store information, using dconnect you'll be able to make apps super easily, with for-dummies examples that are clonable and editable.

along side that there is a lot of projects in our community that can really benefit from eos signalling and storage... can you imagine not needing discord for instant messages? can you imagine being able to have games built and hosted by the community? I can, and this is how we do it, we start a back-end that people can use, and start to use it ourselves.(edited)
so the offer is right now: register and take part, and you'll get a bunch of tokens to play with on the test network, all I need is a pub key to register you with
then when we've decided how many people we need to start with and who needs to register from the start etc etc etc we start the main network that is our permanent home, hopefully leaving the testnet running for tests
those initial members on the mainnet will likely all receive an equal share of system coin, we can all decide on whats a good amount to distribute to the initial members and go from there
