## A new chain is born

A blockchain has launched called **FreedomFirst**, its primary purpose is to run a world class distributed dapp network.

## What is the purpose of **FreedomFirst**?

**FreedomFirst** picks up from the lessons learned on STEEM, Ethereum, EOS, and other large blockchains. STEEM allowed us all to blog in a distributed way, which exposed a lot of people to the potential of blockchain technology for hosting content.

Applications that utilize blockchains, together with other hosting technologies like traditional file hosting, or distributed hosting like IPFS, have recently appeared. Providing a clearer perspective on what is required of good distributed hosting.

Therefore, the initial focus of our project will be to provide formalized mechanisms for hosting decentralized applications and their content.

Tokens are an important aspect of how autonomous communities and smart companies organize themselves. The hybrid approach between hosting content and being able to create tokens creates a perfect environment for applications.

**FreedomFirst** is started without an ICO or corporate ties. It is a truly decentral, community-governed endeavour where the focus is on utility from the start.

## What kind of problems do previous networks experience?

Creating or operating tokens is usually expensive or unavailable.
Customization of server behavior is often not available.
Valued content, if falling on distributed hosting,  often disappears from the  network, and there is no easy way to stop it from happening on current systems.
Without customizable storage and server behavior, content unrelated to specific applications can spill over from other ones.
The ability to edit published content can be either difficult to design, or doesn’t work well in  practice.
Storage of content is fragmented on current networks, applications don’t share a formal storage mechanism.
Development a huge undertaking, and currently require hosts that resemble classical centralized websites, and also require extensive knowledge of the network(s) that they exist on.
It is impossible for ordinary people to take part in the hosting of the existing popular networks because of huge corporate stakes.

## How does **FreedomFirst** solve this?

**FreedomFirst** runs on the EOSIO blockchain software, since it’s the fastest and most customizable blockchain around. From the very start, the issues of token creation and custom server operations are solved. 

When storing information, **FreedomFirst** uses smart contracts to index IPFS hashes. IPFS provides seamless data storage and distribution mechanisms, but it doesn’t provide addressing and indexing. A smart contract provides a good mechanism to index information. IPFS, unlike direct blockchain storage, provides a way to store content of any size and any format. This allows apps to store their source data, as well as their content.

The smart contracts provide records of each upload, which is used for searching as well as for tracking long term storage. Apps can track their own content, users can track their own content, and paid services can be established.

The idea being to distribute all aspects of storing information, so that users are not solely dependent on their providers to store their data, and facing the potential loss thereof.

## What will **FreedomFirst** look like?

It has its own decentralized web, called **dConnect**. You can host your own sites and  using this.

On the web, **dConnect** behaves like a classical web-server, you can host any content on it.
On app stores, **dConnect** will get an app through which you can access any dapp on the network, and you will have a bar for your favorites.

## What is the current production status?

The **FreedomFirst** mainnet is live, as well as an early version of dconnect, you can host your own websites and apps. Storage mechanisms have been rolled out to keep content online.

The mechanisms for storing and erasing information has been written and is being tested. 

We have rolled out some early apps to help on-board members, check out the info at the end of the paper.

## What is the development roadmap?

An ecosystem of apps will emerge, being hosted on dconnect, and storing their posts and information using variations of the same storage technique. We’re focusing on using these techniques to create a few important community apps, initially we’ll be working on:

Formalized API/toolkit for app creation
Homepage creation/CMS
Blogging
Microblogging
Media sharing
Messaging
Instant Messaging/File transfer/Audio/Video chat
